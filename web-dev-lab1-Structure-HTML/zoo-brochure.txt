About the Zoo

The Ithaca Zoo is New York’s premier hillside zoo, and fun for the whole family.

Founded in 1972, we’ve proudly hosted tourists from 37 countries and thousands of local visitors from Tompkins county.

For over 45 years, we’ve been committed to our primary mission: conservation and protection.

Our Animals

We host a wide variety of animals in climate-controlled biomes designed to perfectly match their natural environments.

Our many viewing platforms and walkways provide incredible views of our animals but keep guests at a safe distance.

This is to keep you safe from them, and them safe from you.

However, there are a few animals that are safe for you to feed in supervised sessions.

Just look for the happy zookeeper sign along edge of the enclosure to learn about the time and location for these opportunities.

Main Attractions

In addition to our wonderful animals, the zoo includes a fully functional food court featuring some of Ithaca’s best chefs.

Directions

Head west from downtown Ithaca on Highway 79 until you reach the bend in the road.

You’ll see three large signs indicating the turnoff to the Ithaca Zoo.

You can also take the TCAT line 340 from Trumansburg; it will drop you off right at the zoo.

Come check out the zoo today!
