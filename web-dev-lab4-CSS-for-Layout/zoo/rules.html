  <p> It is <em>very important</em> for all guests to follow the rules during their stay at the zoo, both for their safety and the safety of the animals. As the old saying goes, <q>Better safe than sorry!</q></p>

  <h2>General Rules:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><em>Keep any children in your sight at all times to ensure they are behaving safely.</em></li>
    <li>If you see anyone in distress, be sure to alert the zoo staff. </li>
    <li><em>Absolutely no smoking on zoo grounds.</em>. Smoking is a health hazard for fellow guests and the animals. Please see <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm">this guide from the CDC on health issues related to smoking</a>.</li>
    <li>Be kind and courteous to the others guests. Everyone is here to have a fun time.</li>
    <li>Please do not cut in line at the concessions stands. Wait your turn.</li>
    <li>Throw away all trash in the designated trash bins. Leave the zoo cleaner than you found it! In the words of zookeper Albert: <q>Don't be mean, keep the zoo clean!</q></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Rules for Interacting With Animals:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><em>Do not disturb or harass the animals.</em> You will be asked to leave the zoo.</li>
    <li>The only time it is acceptable to feed the animals is under the supervision of a zookeeper at one of the appointed stations. Look for the sign with a giraffe eating a green leaf.</li>
    <li>If you want to take pictures of the animals, please turn off the flash.</li>
  </ol>
