  <p>
    Our most popular animal is our friendly pal Jeff the Giraffe!
    Jeff uses his long neck to chomp down on leaves from tall trees or snacks from zookeepers all the way up on the observation platform.
    Don't be scared of Jeff's long tongue; if he licks you, that means he likes you!
  </p>

  <p>
  Jeff, like all giraffes, sleeps very little (&lt; 30 minutes a night) in make sure he is alert & ready to avoid predators. No wonder he eats so much every day (&lt; 50 pounds of leaves)!
